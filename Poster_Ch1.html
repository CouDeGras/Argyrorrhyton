	  <h1>Navigation Computer System (<em>Ombropompon</em>)</h1>
    <h2>Computer Vision: YOLOv8n</h2>
    <p>To enable real-time perception of houseplants for targeted irrigation, an on-board vision system utilizing the lightweight YOLOv8n object detection model was developed. A dataset of 914 houseplant images from <em>Aspidistra</em> and <em>Epipremnum</em> species was curated by extracting frames from videos recorded by a robotic platform in indoor environments of a local university, simulating real-life operating conditions. The dataset was further augmented to 2113 images, with 1893 for training and 190 for validation, using automated labeling on <em>roboflow.com</em> and preprocessing techniques like resizing and noise introduction. Transfer learning was employed by initializing YOLOv8n with pre-trained weights and the model is trained locally. However, overfitting was observed around the 60th iteration due to limited dataset size and diversity, highlighting the need for further optimization strategies to improve generalization capabilities.</p>

	 <h2>SLAM and Navigation: Google Cartographer and Nav2 SMAC Planner</h2>
    <p>Precise robot localization and mapping leveraged Google Cartographer SLAM integrated with ROS2, utilizing a planar LIDAR for forward scanning. SLAM maps were visualized in Rviz2 along with the robot's trajectory for monitoring performance. The vision system's polar houseplant coordinates were transformed to Cartesian positions on the SLAM-derived maps. These global houseplant locations served as waypoints for ROS2 Nav2's SMAC planner to compute obstacle-free navigation routes across the field, dynamically adjusting with new map data, enabling autonomous precision irrigation of detected plants.</p>

  <h2>Interfacing with Peripheral Microcontrollers over Encrypted WSN <em>(Hieroglossa)</em></h2>
  <p>
    To ensure secure and reliable communication between the main computer and distributed microcontrollers, an encrypted wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture was implemented, codenamed <em>Hieroglossa</em>.
  </p>

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>Hieroglossa</em> WSN comprised the central robot computer acting as the base station, along with several microcontroller nodes interfaced to sensors and actuators like pumps and motors. This decentralized topology enabled modular expansion of functionality, as well as physical isolation from single-point electrical failures.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Protocol Syntax</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Hieroglossa</em> protocol governs the syntax for exchanging data packets over the wireless network. This protocol defined message formats, addressing schemes, and encryption standards to prevent eavesdropping or malicious interference.

    <h3>Argyrorrhyton (ἀργυρόρρυτον)</h3>
    <p><em>Argyrorrhyton</em> (ἀργυρόρρυτον) is an ancient Greek word meaning "silver-flowing" or "with a stream of silver". It is a compound word formed from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ἄργυρος (argyros) = silver</li>
      <li>ῥύτον (rhyton) = stream, current</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So <em>argyrorrhyton</em> literally means "silver-flowing" or "having a flow/stream of silver". It was used to describe things that had a silver appearance or shimmer, like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A silver-colored river or stream</li>
      <li>Something made of or adorned with silver that seemed to flow/shimmer like liquid silver</li>
      <li>Metallic ornamentation or embellishments on objects that had a silver-like flow to them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The word captures the liquid, flowing quality of silver and was a poetic way to describe the radiant shine and reflective properties of silver or other precious metals/materials in ancient Greek literature and poetry.</p>
    <p>So in essence, <em>argyrorrhyton</em> evokes the image of a shimmering silver stream or something with a brilliant silver flow or sheen to it. It's a vivid descriptive word highlighting silver's liquid-like luster.</p>

    <h3>Ombropompon (ὀμβροπόμπον)</h3>
    <p><em>Ombropompon</em> (ὀμβροπόμπον) is an ancient Greek word that means "rain-sending" or "rain-bringing". It breaks down into two components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ὄμβρος (ombros) = rain, shower</li>
      <li>πέμπων (pempon) = sending, conducting (present participle of the verb pempein, to send)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So the literal meaning of <em>ombropompon</em> is "that which sends/brings rain" or "rain-sending".</p>
    <p>In ancient Greek poetry and literature, it was often used to describe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storm clouds that brought rain</li>
      <li>The winds that carried rain clouds</li>
      <li>Deities or natural forces believed to be responsible for sending rainfall</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, it could refer to Storm clouds as the "<em>ombropompon nephos</em>" (ὀμβροπόμπον νέφος) - the "rain-sending cloud". Or it may describe the winds as "<em>ombropompon aurai</em>" (ὀμβροπόμπον αὖραι) - the "rain-bringing breezes".</p>
    <p>It captures the idea of rain being sent, conducted, or brought by some force of nature in colorful, poetic language.</p>
    <p>So in essence, <em>ombropompon</em> vividly personifies the phenomena that deliver rainfall as "the rain-sender" or "rain-bringer". It evokes the imagery of rain being purposely dispatched.</p>

    <h3>Phytognomon (φυτογνώμων)</h3>
    <p><em>Phytognomon</em> (φυτογνώμων) is an ancient Greek word that means "plant judge" or "botanist". It is a compound word formed from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>φυτόν (phyton) = plant</li>
      <li>γνώμων (gnōmōn) = one who judges, discerns or knows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So the literal translation of <em>phytognomon</em> is "plant judge" or "one who judges/discerns plants".</p>
    <p>In ancient Greece, a <em>phytognomon</em> referred to someone who studied and had expert knowledge of plants - essentially what we would call a botanist today. Their roles included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying and classifying different plant species</li>
      <li>Understanding the properties, uses and cultivation of plants</li>
      <li>Being able to distinguish edible from poisonous plants</li>
      <li>Expertise in Plant morphology and anatomy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The word highlights their ability to properly "judge" or discern the characteristics and natures of plants through close observation and knowledge.</p>
    <p><em>Phytognomon</em> was a term of respect for those who dedicated themselves to the scientific study of the plant kingdom in ancient times. It recognized their skill as devoted "judges" of the vast world of vegetation.</p>
    <p>So in summary, this vivid ancient Greek word refers to botanists or plant experts who could authoritatively judge, discern and impart knowledge about the amazing diversity of plants around them.</p>

    <h3>Hieroglossa (ἱερόγλωσσα)</h3>
    <p><em>Hieroglossa</em> (ἱερόγλωσσα) is an ancient Greek word that means "sacred tongue" or "sacred language". It is a compound word formed from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ἱερός (hieros) = sacred, holy</li>
      <li>γλῶσσα (glōssa) = tongue, language</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So the literal translation of <em>hieroglossa</em> is "sacred tongue" or "holy language".</p>
    <p>In ancient Greece, the term was used to refer to the languages used in religious rituals, ceremonies, and sacred texts. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It could refer to ancient languages like Sanskrit that were considered divine/priestly languages.</li>
      <li>It described the Greek language itself when used for religious purposes in prayers, hymns, oracles etc.</li>
      <li>Some ancient writers used it to refer to the obscure, symbolic language found in hieroglyphics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The word <em>hieroglossa</em> captures the idea that certain languages were considered hallowed and reserved for spiritual/religious contexts. Using the "sacred tongue" lent solemnity and divine significance.</p>
    <p>So in ancient times, a <em>hieroglossa</em> was a language elevated above common speech and imbued with sacred properties when used for holy rituals, texts, and communications with the divine according to ancient beliefs.</p>
    <p>It provides insight into how languages developed special, rarefied forms considered suitable for interfacing with the realm of the sacred and supernatural according to ancient beliefs.</p>

    <h3>Pilentum</h3>
    <p><em>Pilentum</em> is a Latin word that refers to a type of carriage or wagon used in ancient Rome. The <em>pilentum</em> was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A four-wheeled covered carriage or wagon</li>
      <li>Used for transporting upper-class women, particularly matrons (married women)</li>
      <li>Drawn by mules or horses</li>
      <li>Distinguished by having an arched cloth cover over the top</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The word <em>pilentum</em> comes from the Latin word "pilus" meaning hair, referring to the covering of cloth or hairy skins over the top of the carriage.</p>
    <p>The <em>pilentum</em> provided both shade and privacy for the female occupants inside as they traveled. It allowed upper-class Roman women to ride in a modest, covered conveyance suitable for their social standing.</p>
    <p>Certain religious ceremonies and rituals also involved the use of the <em>pilentum</em> to transport statues of goddesses or matrons participating in the proceedings.</p>
    <p>So in summary, a <em>pilentum</em> was an enclosed, covered carriage that allowed privileged Roman women to travel while maintaining their social status and gender norms regarding visibility and seclusion in public spaces. It became associated with female members of Rome's elite classes.</p>

    <h3>Aquamanile</h3>
    <p><em>Aquamanile</em> is a Latin word that refers to a vessel used for handwashing, especially in religious or ceremonial contexts. It comes from the Latin words:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aqua = water</li>
      <li>Manile = hand-basin or handwashing vessel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So an <em>aquamanile</em> is literally a "hand-water vessel" or "water for hand-washing container."</p>
    <p>Specifically, an <em>aquamanile</em> was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A pitcher or ewer with a basin designed to catch the water for handwashing</li>
      <li>Often decoratively shaped like an animal or mythical creature</li>
